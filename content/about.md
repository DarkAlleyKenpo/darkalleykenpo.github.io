Welcome to the Desert Dragons Kenpo Karate technique page. This page started as a black belt project by Chris Deluca, and is a work in progress at this time (December 2018). The contents of this web site represent the major motions, strikes, foot and body positions and movements as recorded and remembered by Chris - at the time he learned them (so yellow belt techniques, as recorded by a yellow belt). Mr. Gonzalez often alters the techniques for better effect and some of those alterations have not necessarily been captured here. As this project progresses, these changes will be codified and this statement removed.

For more information, class schedules, etc. please visit the normal [Desert Dragons Kenpo Karate](http://www.desertdragonsaz.com) web site.
